# Resilient Email Sending Service

This project implements a resilient email sending service in Node.js. It's designed to handle provider failures gracefully by incorporating features like automatic retries, fallback to a secondary provider, rate limiting, and circuit breakers.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Retry Logic**: Automatically retries sending an email with exponential backoff if a provider fails.
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Switches to a secondary provider if the primary provider fails all retry attempts.
- **Idempotency**: Prevents duplicate email sends for the same operation using a unique key.
- **Rate Limiting**: Throttles the number of outgoing emails to avoid overwhelming providers.
- **In-Memory Queue**: Buffers emails that exceed the rate limit and processes them later.
- **Circuit Breaker**: Temporarily stops sending requests to a provider that is consistently failing.
- **Status Tracking**: Monitors the final status of each email send request (`success`, `failed`, `duplicate`, `rate_limited`).
- **Console Logging**: Provides timestamped logs for all major events.
